I spend a big chunk of my day on the Internet. Most of that time is sadly unproductive, but I won't dive into the details since it would take me the whole post to lay down my procrastination problem (and frankly nobody gives a damn anyways).
During my online activities, I usually stumble upon some trending [memes][1] on social media, public forums, and even private chats. Whether we like it or not, internet memes are now a living part of almost any internet society, and I'd even go as far as calling it an identity.

In this post, we will discuss Internet Time, which is a notion often associated with memes. We begin by following the history of Internet Time to it's roots, then we will study its impact on our everyday discussions before going further in our analysis to see how in fact "Internet Time" is part of the aftermath of a global societal change.
