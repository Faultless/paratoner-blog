> "Humans are creatures of habit"

We've all heard this sentence a dozen times at least in our lives, and it is very true: in our everyday life we develop certain routines and patterns which help us go about our lives using our brain as little as possible. Indeed, most of our actions are mechanical, born from habits, ingrained from our childhood by our entourage.
What I find fascinating about this topic is how easy it is to develop a toxic bad habit such as smoking or "checking" social media for hours on end, while it is so difficult to maintain a healthy productive habit even for a short term. Now why is this? How can we put an end to the vicious cycle of bad habits? Is it possible to potentially replace bad rituals with more productive ones, and stick to them on the long term?

Those questions will be answered in today's post.

### Calling things by their names: Definitions

According to [Merriam-Webster][1], a habit is

> A behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance.

Analysing this quickly, we see the words **behavior** and **pattern** among others of the same family, which demonstrates that a habit is less so a conscious intellectual activity, but rather a mechanical sub-counscious process enhanced through repetitions.
Here resides the power of habit: through sub-conscious patterns and without any conscious effort from the subject, a habit is born and nurtured.

By looking at the webster definition more closely, we can see that a behavior can manifest iteself through regularity on the subject's part, but also through an increase in facility of performance. This second point is especially important because it embodies the good side of habits (what makes it so popular among sociologists).
