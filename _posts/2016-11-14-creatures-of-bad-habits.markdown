> "Humans are creatures of habit"

We've all heard this sentence a dozen times at least in our lives, and it is very true: in our everyday life we develop certain routines and patterns which help us go about our lives using our brain as little as possible. Indeed, most of our actions are mechanical, born from habits, ingrained from our childhood by our entourage.
What I find fascinating about this topic is how easy it is to develop a toxic bad habit such as smoking or "checking" social media for hours on end, while it is so difficult to maintain a healthy productive habit even for a short term. Now why is this? How can we put an end to the vicious cycle of bad habits? Is it possible to potentially replace bad rituals with more productive ones, and stick to them on the long term?

Those questions will be answered in today's post.

### Calling things by their names: Definitions

According to [Merriam-Webster][1], a habit is

> A behavior pattern acquired by frequent repetition or physiologic exposure that shows itself in regularity or increased facility of performance.

Analysing this quickly, we see the words **behavior** and **pattern** among others of the same family, which demonstrates that a habit is less so a conscious intellectual activity, but rather a mechanical sub-counscious process enhanced through repetitions.
Here resides the power of habit: through sub-conscious patterns and without any conscious effort from the subject, a habit is born and nurtured.

By looking at the webster definition more closely, we can see that a behavior can manifest itself through regularity on the subject's part, but also through an increase in facility of performance. This second point is especially important because it embodies the good side of habits (what makes it so popular among sociologists).   

But what exactly is a good habit then? Let's take a scientific definition from the [Medical Dictionary][2], where they define it as a "behavior beneficial to one's mental or physical health".. But this is not enough, because procrastinators might find joy and bliss through escapism using video games, television, or whatever provides this means of avoiding one's duties. For this reason, the definition extends by saying that such habits must be linked to a high level of discipline and self-control; which brings us to our next point: how is a bad habit developped? How can we avoid it or better yet fix it once it's ingrained in us?


### An everyday challenge: Ditching our bad habits

As I am writing this post, one of my biggest bad habits kicks in: quitting halfway through a task. While this might be argued to be a case of [attention deficit disorder][3], I firmly believe that there is no room for excuses when it comes to your own undisciplined mind; and here's where the medical definition of a good habit is proven. Keeping a good habit going for a long term and potentially for life is an everyday battle with your undisciplined mind, which leads to a vicious cycle of trying to forge good habits but fail because of your lack of discipline which in turn requires a habit of self-control and discipline to fix. 

I've long since lost count of my failed attempts to forge habits, I've tried it all but it never really works for me. The only way for me to commit to a task is through daily timed obligations. This last idea begs the question: can good habits be turned into obligations in order to stick with them? 

My answer is maybe, but I believe it defeats the purpose of good habits. A good habit should originate from the person itself for it to have a meaning, and to last it must be an enjoyable activity (talking about real long lasting joy from a sense of accomplishment for example).
