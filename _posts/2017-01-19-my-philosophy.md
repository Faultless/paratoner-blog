### What do I care about?

I'm having a hard time differenciating between **what i like as a hobby**, and **what I like as a philosophy (a.k.a. my way of life).**

To kick off, let's start by listing all of the things that could qualify as a hobby of mine:

1 - Working out
2 - Sports
3 - EDM Production
4 - Pixel Art
5 - Game Development
6 - Japanese culture

### Working out

One year ago, I have taken a big decision in my life: hitting the gym every-single-day. At the start, it was a natural reaction to my skinny-fat, weak, lazy self that was slowly but surely eating away at every aspect of my life. As time went by, I have acquired the discipline and long-term goal-oriented mindset of bodybuilding. 
Working out, coupled with daily meditation, as well as self improvement reading has taken me a long way towards curing my vices - which are numerous. 

### Side hobbies

Through the course of my life-changing year, I have picked up many a hobby along the way, including **Basketball** to boost my agility, precision, endurance, as well as teamwork; **EDM Production to tackle music theory** the way I like it; and also **Pixel Art** which I have kind of put down for a few months now because of a period of complacency and binge gaming. 

### The choice

The two things I am constantly excited about are Games in general and Japanese Culture, more specifically Anime. I have decided to turn the vices of binge-watching/playing anime/games into useful hobbies and even life paths. **My dream** as a computer enthusiast is to one day join a big game Development company and contribute in building the ultimate gaming experience for fans around the world.
